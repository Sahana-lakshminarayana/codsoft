During my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on diverse AI projects that honed my skills in practical applications of artificial intelligence. My tasks included developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI strategies to enhance gameplay, creating a chatbot to facilitate natural language interactions and provide efficient responses, and designing a recommendation system to suggest personalized content based on user preferences. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, deepen my understanding of machine learning algorithms, and contribute to innovative solutions in the AI field.
